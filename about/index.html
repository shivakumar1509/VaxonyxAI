              Kempaiah Rayavara, PhD, is the Founder and President of Vaxonyx. With 20+ years leading
              interdisciplinary research, he specializes in harnessing artificial intelligence and molecular
              biology to address infectious diseases, cancer, and immune disorders. He has guided programs
              from discovery through IND submission and FDA approval, including preclinical GLP safety and
              efficacy studies in rodent and non-human primate models.
            </p>
            <p class="team-blurb">
              Previously, as Director of Preclinical R&amp;D at Imunon Inc., he led the design and development
              of a plasmid DNA vaccine, overseeing IND-enabling efficacy, biodistribution, and toxicology
              studies that resulted in Phase I clinical approval. Earlier, at NIAID/NIH, he contributed to
              the identification of the malaria parasite gene responsible for the PSAC nutrient acquisition
              channel. His experience spans drug-mechanism research for tissue repair (Chrysalis BioTherapeutics)
              and development of models for respiratory viruses (RSV, COVID-19, influenza) at UTMB and Southern Research—
              playing a key role in establishing COVID-19 models during the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p class="team-blurb">
              He earned his PhD in Biochemistry studying the pharmaceutical potential of nutraceuticals against
